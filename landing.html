        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a Portland Native who is jumping head first into the world of web development. My background is in theater, having performed for the last 15 years and received a B.A. in Theater Arts from Azusa Pacific University. I spent several years in the service industry before coming to the conclusion that the future of the job market is in the tech industry. I chose to take a leap towards that future by enrolling in web development classes at Epicodus. This is a sampling of some of my work in those classes, and also a little more about my life and who I am. Enjoy.</p>
