          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Portland native who is jumping head first into the world of <em>web development</em>. My background is in theater, having performed for the last 15 years and received a B.A. in Theater Arts from Azusa Pacific University. I spent several years in the service industry before coming to the conclusion that the future of the job market is in the tech industry. I chose to take a leap towards that future by enrolling in web development classes at Epicodus. This is a sampling of some of my work in those classes, and also a little more about my life and who I am. Enjoy.</p>

              <h1>Projects</h1>
              <p>Here is a sampling of my work in <span class="school">Epicodus</span>. Each repo contains a project that taught different development skills. Some skills came easier than others, and my classmates were a constant source of help (as was google).</p>
              <ol>
                <li>This project, "<a href="https://github.com/ltmoocow14/Pet-blog.git" target="blank">Udder Animals</a>," came from the very fist day of class. It utilizes basic html code with images inlaid, and some use of inline styling.</li>
                <li>This <a href="https://github.com/ltmoocow14/First-webpage.git" target="blank">second repository</a> contains two pages that were intended to practice styling using a CSS stylesheet. Both pages are crude in terms of content, but display an understanding of basic CSS consepts.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/ltmoocow14/travel-site.git" target="blank">This</a> is another example of styling with CSS, including using hexidecimal codes.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://github.com/ltmoocow14/styling-with-classes.git" target="blank">fourth repo</a> contains two projects that demonstrate an understanding of &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements.</li>
                <li>The repo "<a href="https://github.com/ltmoocow14/travel-site.git" target="blank">Travel Site</a>" has a multi-page website for a fictional travel company. It was an early example of building links, styling with CSS, and playing with image manipulation.</li>
                <li>Finally, this <a href="https://github.com/ltmoocow14/bootstrap-practice.git" target="blank">last repo</a> holds an example of our lesson in content boxes, containers, and floating in CSS. It also incorporates using Bootstrap's premade stylesheet in conjunction with my own. The Italy and Packages pages link together to create a small travel info site. This repo also contains an attempt to recreate the Wikipedia home page. As of now, there is only content in html, but CSS styling is coming forthwith.</li>
